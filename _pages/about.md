Before I start telling you who I am and bothering you with things you may not want to know, let me clear two things. First, I’d prefer to write in my own words and make mistakes along the way than hand over the process to ChatGPT or any other LLM, so yes, you’ll likely find errors and typos. Second, I really don’t like to be wordy, hence I’ll tend to be as concise as I can.
