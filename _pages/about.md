Before I start telling you who I am and bothering you with things you may not want to know, let me clear two things. First, I’d prefer to write in my own words and make mistakes along the way than hand over the process to ChatGPT or any other LLM, so yes, you’ll likely find errors and typos. Second, I really don’t like to be wordy, hence I’ll tend to be as concise as I can. 

Now that we are on the same page let's move on talking about the boring stuff.

I’m a PhD student in Enterprise Engineering at the [Università degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/), interested in studying luxury consumers’ online (social media) behavior. Now, you might ask: “Why are you into this specific topic?” 

The short answer is, I don’t know either. 

The long answer comprises two different points. 

1)	**Luxury brands are losing out on the “holy grail” of social media.** In their seminal work published in Computers in Human Behavior, [Habibi and colleagues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002258?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=9a9296c24fb0d7df) describe customer engagement as the “Holy Grail” of social media, rightfully, I may add. We live in the so-called [attention economy](https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article/37/1/18/7733851), in which human attention is the most scarce and valuable resource; it’s no coincidence that every brand and organization on our green earth seeks to gain a larger share of customers’ attention and engagement.  In this climate, however, luxury brands are losing the consumer's attention battle, facing an astonishing 40% decline in social media engagement compared to 2022, according to a 2025 [Bain & Company report](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/luxury-confronts-slowdown-amid-economic-headwinds-and-market-disruptions-while-industry-resilience-and-strong-fundamentals-underpin-future-prospects/). 

2)	**If we can understand the why, perhaps we could do something to get back on track.** The Bain & Company report lists a series of causes that may be driving this engagement slowdown, which spans from doubting whether soaring prices are justified to questioning whether creativity, craftsmanship, and quality are truly being upheld. What is clear is that luxury brands are not connecting with their most powerful stakeholder, consumers, who, in turn, are falling out of love with them. In light of all these considerations, I posit that exploring the reasons and mechanisms behind consumers' decisions to engage (and why they do not) will be a fundamental step to developing a new luxury language that can be leveraged in the process of re-engagement. 

Now, not to boast, but such research could also contribute to the **sustainable luxury discussion**.  According to [Amy Nelson-Bennett](https://www.luxurydaily.com/seize-the-moment-how-sustainability-storytelling-can-reignite-luxurys-spark/) (CEO of Positive Luxury), consumers are “turning away from shiny storytelling, jaded by yet another collab, disillusioned by values exposed as hypocrisy.” Essentially, consumers are more and more skeptical of traditional luxury storytelling; they don’t buy it anymore. Bennet insists that this skepticism stems from dull and shallow sustainability messages that are, to be blunt, just virtue signaling. Randomly weaving sustainability messages along the value creation process is simply not enough; what it takes to win back consumers' trust lies in providing proof, and along with that, doing it with a new language of storytelling. To sum up, luxury brands need a new language to create compelling stories about actual sustainability efforts to win back consumers’ trust. The bottom line is that in order to do this, the fundamental step is to explore what consumers actually want to hear and why.

Ok, now I’m actually done. Was it boring enough?
