This paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry through a literature review based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling. While previous reviews have employed narrative or systematic approaches grounded in keyword co-occurrence, citation networks, or predefined topic categories, this study adopts an unsupervised learning technique capable of identifying latent themes within large volumes of unstructured data. This methodological shift allows for a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of emerging trends in AI applications across diverse healthcare domains. The literature review, conducted in the ISI Web of Science Core Collection, initially identified 36,113 documents. Applying exclusion criteria (English-language, Q1 peer-reviewed journals, ≥5 citations, complete metadata) reduced the dataset to 1,962 papers. The findings reveal three overarching themes that underpin the integration of AI in healthcare: data, algorithms, and decision support systems. These elements are tightly interlinked and collectively essential to successful AI implementation. This study contributes to the growing body of research by identifying the key thematic areas that guide AI integration in healthcare and by highlighting the importance of a holistic approach. It offers valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to understand the evolution of AI in healthcare and to promote more effective, ethical, and robust implementations.
